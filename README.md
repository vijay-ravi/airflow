# Airflow on Docker in EC2 + GitLab's CI/CD

Personal project for simple data pipeline using Airflow. Airflow will be installed inside Docker container, which will be deployed in Amazon's EC2. For continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), GitLab will be used.

## Steps

1. Set up EC2 server. Choose ubuntu. Download the ssh key (with .pem suffix). Open ports of the EC2 instance, especially port 8080.
   `sudo ufw allow 8080`
3. SSH inside your EC2 server. Install Docker and docker-compose.
   Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
   Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
5. Create GitLab account. Create new repository on GitLab, and push this repository there.
6. On your GitLab's project page, open Settings > CI/CD > Repository Variables. Configure several variables:<br>
    * _AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD -> Arbitrary password for Airflow (Variable)<br>
    * _AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_USERNAME -> Arbitrary username for Airflow (Variable)<br>
    * EC2_ADDRESS -> IP address of your EC2 host (Variable)<br>
    * GITLAB_PASSWORD -> GitLab password (Variable)<br>
    * GITLAB_USERNAME -> GitLab username (Variable)<br>
    * SSH_KEY_EC2 -> Your SSH key (with .pem suffix that you downloaded earlier) (File)<br>
7. Configure GitLab's runner for CI/CD
8. Open gitlab-ci.yml, change line 25 and 26 with your email (that registered on GitLab) and Name. If your user name in EC2 is not default (ubuntu), change ubuntu in `ubuntu@EC2_ADDRESS` with the correct username
9. Run CI/CD pipeline, check if the code is deployed properly.
10. SSH to the server to inspect if anything goes wrong
11. Open the Airflow UI in browser on EC2_IP_ADDRESS:8080
